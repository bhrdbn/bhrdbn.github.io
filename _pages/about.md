About Me
------
I am a final-year computer engineering student at [Sharif University of Technology](https://www.sharif.ir) with a deep interest in machine learning, particularly in the areas of **generative models** and **trustworthy AI**. Throughout my academic journey, I have sought opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world research and development environments.

Since last summer, I have been an intern at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk) under the supervision of [Prof. Farzan Farnia](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/farzan-farnia/), where I have focused on evaluating generative models and their diversity using innovative metrics. I also had the opportunity to work in the [RIML lab](https://github.com/rohban-lab) at Sharif University, under [Prof. Mohammad Hossein Rohban](https://sharif.ir/~rohban/)'s supervision, where my research centered on trustworthy AI systems. Additionally, I interned remotely at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu), working with [Prof. Pooyan Jamshidi](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io) on developing tools to better interpret neural networks.

Beyond research, I have gained experience in industry as an R&D engineer at [Tapsi](https://tapsi.ir)(a ridesharing company in Iran), where my team and I developed augmented reality features for their app. These diverse experiences have shaped my understanding of both the academic and practical sides of AI.
<!-- During my time at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, I worked as a Research Assistant under the supervision of Professor Farzan Farnia. Our research focused on investigating the diversity of text-to-image generative models, specifically how they are conditioned on text descriptions. We explored differential clustering methods as a potential approach to better capture and quantify this diversity. Through this experience, I became familiar with the world of generative models and their evaluation metrics, broadening my understanding while refining my research skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence. -->


<!-- Research Assistant at Sharif University of Technology
======
During my time as a Research Assistant at the Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning Lab under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Hossein Rohban, I focused on advancing machine learning robustness and interpretability. My initial work involved conducting literature reviews and experiments on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, particularly addressing spurious correlations. I tested various OOD benchmarks on spurious samples, analyzed the limitations of existing methods, and proposed improvements. This phase of research significantly contributed to understanding the complexities of OOD detection in real-world applications.

Building on this foundation, I worked on detecting backdoor attacks in machine learning models. This project led to the development of a novel detection method, which was accepted at NeurIPS 2024. I also designed a novelty detection method that is robust to style shifts in data distributions by distinguishing core from style features using a teacher-student framework. This research culminated in another paper submission to ICLR 2025, further showcasing my contributions to ensuring more secure and reliable AI systems.

As a Remote Research Assistant at the University of South Carolina under the supervision of Prof. Pooyan Jamshidi, I conducted experiments on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and its variations, such as dCKA, along with other similarity metrics. My research aimed to evaluate and compare these methods for measuring similarity between neural networks, identifying their strengths and proposing improvements to enhance their performance and interpretability.

In the area of Machine Unlearning, I worked on designing a method that enables selective data removal from models by applying adjustments to the modelâ€™s structure. This project aimed to develop an efficient unlearning technique while maintaining the integrity and performance of the machine learning model.

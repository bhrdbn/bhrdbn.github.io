During my time at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, I worked as a Research Assistant under the supervision of Professor Farzan Farnia. Our research focused on investigating the diversity of text-to-image generative models, specifically how they are conditioned on text descriptions. We explored differential clustering methods as a potential approach to better capture and quantify this diversity. Through this experience, I became familiar with the world of generative models and their evaluation metrics, broadening my understanding while refining my research skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
